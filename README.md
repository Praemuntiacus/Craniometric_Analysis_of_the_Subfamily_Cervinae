**THE AIM OF THE STUDY**
The objective of this study is to conduct a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on cranial measurements of both fossil and modern deer belonging to the subfamily Cervinae, with the goal of characterizing the cranial morphological diversity within this taxonomic group. The repository includes the dataset (available in both Excel and CSV formats) and a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Praemuntiacus/Craniometric_Analysis_of_the_Subfamily_Cervinae/blob/main/CERVIDAE_CRANIOMETRY.ipynb) showcasing all stages of data preprocessing, imputation, analysis, and diagram generation.

**RESEARCH METHODS**

The craniological material comprises over 300 skulls of both modern and fossil representatives of the subfamily Cervinae. The fossil and modern osteological specimens utilized in this study are curated at various institutions, including the Institute of Zoology of the State University of Moldova (IZM), Republic of Moldova; the Institute of Zoology of the University of Wroclaw (IZW), Poland; the Museum of Geology and Paleontology of the University of Florence (MGUF), Italy; the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (MNHN), Paris, France; the Museum of Paleontology of the Department of Earth Sciences (MPS), University of Rome “Sapienza”, Italy; the Natural History Museum “Grigore Antipa” (NHMB), Bucharest, Romania; the Natural History Museum of London (NHML), United Kingdom; the Natural History Museum “La Specola” (NHMF), University of Florence, Italy; the Paleontological Museum of the University “Claude Bernard” Lyon 1 (PMUL), France; and the State Museum of Natural History of Stuttgart (SMNH), Germany.
Some cranial measurements of Cervus elaphus are adapted from Heptner and Tzalkin (1947), while cranial measurements for Candiacervus ropalophorus are adapted from Schilling and Roessner (2021). Detailed information regarding cranial specimens, their collection numbers, institutions of curation, and measurements can be found in Table 1S of the supplementary materials.
